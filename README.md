# Price monitoring system: Project nÂ°2 (OpenClassrooms)

## Scenario

You're a marketing analyst at Books Online, a leading online bookstore specializing in used books. As part of your job, you try to manually track the prices of used books on your competitors' websites, but it's too much work and you can't cope: there are too many books and too many online bookstores! You and your team have decided to automate this laborious task via a program (a scraper) developed in Python, capable of extracting pricing information from other online bookstores.
